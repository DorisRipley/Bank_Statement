# Personal Finances Summary Dashboard

## Summary:
This project entails the development of an interactive and insightful dashboard focused on managing and visualizing personal financial transactions. The dashboard is constructed using Python and integrates several libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, HoloViz's Panel for crafting interactive panels, Hvplot for plot rendering, and Google Drive and Sheets APIs for accessing and manipulating spreadsheet data.

## Objective:
The chief objective of this dashboard is to provide a unified view of personal income, expenses, and savings, enabling more informed and effective financial management and decision-making. It furnishes users with visual depictions of transaction data, revealing trends and summarizations across various expense categories and providing insights into the savings of the latest month.

The Panel library powers the deployment of the dashboard, ensuring it is web-accessible and user-friendly, offering interactive and detailed financial analyses to users.

Impact:
This interactive dashboard serves as an invaluable resource for individuals aiming to delve deeper into their spending habits, discover potential areas for financial optimization, and fortify their financial well-being.

By combining the robustness of Python libraries with the versatility of Google APIs, this project stands as a testament to the potential of modern data visualization and analysis in personal financial management.
